# Aquila - Vulkan PBR Rendering Engine

This project is a **Vulkan-based PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) engine** built entirely from scratch with the primary goal of learning and exploring modern graphics programming, Vulkan API usage, and real-time rendering techniques.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **This project is for educational purposes only.**  
> It is not designed to compete with existing game engines, commercial or open-source, nor is that its goal. The primary intent is personal growth and experimentation in the field of graphics programming.


## About

This engine serves as a hands-on learning platform to:

- Understand the Vulkan graphics API in depth
- Implement modern PBR shading workflows
- Integrate image-based lighting (IBL)
- Explore efficient rendering pipelines and GPU resource management
- Experiment with common rendering features like shadow mapping, normal mapping, and post-processing

## Features

- **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)** using metallic-roughness workflow
- **Runtime IBL (Image-Based Lighting)** computation from HDR environment maps
- **Material editing** at runtime, including base color, metallic, roughness, emissive, and AO control
- **Model loading** with Assimp (.obj, .gltf, etc.)
- Real-time viewport rendering
- Clean and modular C++ architecture focused on learning and extensibility
- Fallback texture system for missing material maps
